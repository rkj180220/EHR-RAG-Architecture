# üè• Healthcare EHR Chatbot using RAG on AWS

This project demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system built to allow healthcare providers to interact with scanned patient records (PDFs) using natural language questions.

## üìå Use Case

Doctors and healthcare providers often need to retrieve specific information ‚Äî such as past diagnoses, medication history, or allergies ‚Äî from large and unstructured patient documents. These documents are typically uploaded as scanned PDFs in EHR systems.

This project uses **RAG** to enable providers to ask conversational queries and receive context-rich, accurate answers powered by LLMs and document retrieval.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Scanned PDF Upload**: Patient records are uploaded to the EHR system as scanned PDFs.
2. **Text Extraction (OCR)**: Amazon Textract converts scanned PDFs into raw text.
3. **Chunking + Metadata Extraction**: An AWS Lambda function breaks the text into logical chunks and extracts metadata (e.g., patient ID, section headers).
4. **Embeddings Generation**: Amazon Bedrock generates vector embeddings from the chunks.
5. **Vector Storage**: Chunks are stored in a Vector DB (e.g., Amazon OpenSearch or FAISS).
6. **Provider Query**: A doctor queries the system via an EHR-integrated chat UI (via API Gateway).
7. **Backend ECS Service**:
    - Embeds the user query using Bedrock.
    - Retrieves top-k relevant chunks from the vector DB.
    - Assembles the prompt with context.
8. **Answer Generation**: Bedrock (Claude/GPT) generates a grounded response.
9. **Response Delivery**: The result is returned to the doctor via the UI.

## üîê Security & HIPAA Compliance

This system is designed with security and compliance in mind:

- ‚úÖ Uses **HIPAA-eligible AWS services** (Textract, S3, Bedrock, Lambda, ECS)
- ‚úÖ Data encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (S3 with KMS)
- ‚úÖ Secure access control using AWS IAM
- ‚úÖ Network-level protections via VPCs, private subnets, and endpoint policies
- ‚úÖ Logging and auditing via CloudTrail and CloudWatch
